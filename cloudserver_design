Methods

Ruby or Node.js

I will use Ruby to do the tasks for cloudserver trial assignment.
My reason for this decision:
1. I have use Ruby (on Rails) in many project for 1,5 year. I only learn node.js less than a month but then the plan to use it in the project got cancelled.
2. I'm more familiar with test for Ruby (rspec and cucumber), than the test for node.js
3. Given the deadline is near and I still need to learn Amazon EC2, then there will be not enough time to also learn Node.js

Design for assigned tasks:

Task 1:
Develop command line program to enumerate running Ec2 instances then save into database.

Application design:
1. Create single ruby code that will use GLI to provide command line.
2. Use amazon-ec2 gem to fetch Ec2 instances that currently running.
3. Save the data into database

Database design

Based on this API reference:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeInstances.html

Here is the design of database that I will create:

Instances
	string:instance-id
	string:instance-type
	string:dns-name
	string:architecture
	integer:instance-state-code
	string:instance-state-name
	string:state-reason-code
	string:state-reason-message
	string:monitoring-state

For the app, I will create a single file ruby code that using GLI.
The AWS configuration will be stored in separated yml file.
The required gems will be listed using Gemfile.
